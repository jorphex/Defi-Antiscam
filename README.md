Inspired by [danijelthales](https://github.com/danijelthales) antiscam bot.

🛡️ Federated Ban Propagation  
  A ban for a user in one server is automatically enforced across the entire network. Unbanning a user from the origin server will also propagate the unban globally.

🤖 Member Screening  
  New users are automatically scanned upon joining against the federated ban list, and the global and server-specific keywords in their nicknames, usernames, and bios.

🚨 Real-time Message Scanning  
  The bot monitors chat for scam links, malicious phrases, and advanced obfuscation. It instantly deletes matched messages and puts the user in timeout.

🔎 Rich Context on Federated Actions  
  The original flagged message, bio, or keywords that triggered the ban in a server are included in federated ban notice messages in the other servers allowing your team to make informed decisions.

ℹ️ Interactive Alerts  
  Alert messages are sent to your specified private channel with buttons to Ban, Kick, Unban, or Ignore (removes timeout). The UI allows for quick reversals if a mistake is made.

⚖️ Autonomy & Local Control  
  If a federated ban does not fit your community's rules, your mods can locally unban the user. This affects only your server without overriding the decision for the rest of the federation.

⚙️ Keyword & Regex Matching  
  Manage keyword lists via Discord's synced slash commands. It supports aggressive substring matching, precise "smart" word matching, and regex patterns for flexibility.

🧹 Retroactive Server Scanning  
  The bot can run a retroactive scan of all users in your server to find and flag dormant scam accounts that joined before the bot was active.

📊 Federation Statistics  
  Track how many bans your server has initiated and received, and the federation total, giving you a clear view of the federation's impact.
