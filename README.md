# Discord Defi Antiscam Bot

A federated antiscam bot to proactively protect DeFi and crypto communities. Inspired by the work of [danijelthales](https://github.com/danijelthales).

## Core Features

üõ°Ô∏è **Federated Network**: A ban in one server is instantly propagated to all others. New servers can be onboarded to receive the entire historical collective ban list, providing immediate protection.

ü§ñ **Automatic Screening**:
- **On Join**: Scans usernames, bios, and cross-references against the global federated ban list.
- **On Message**: Scans message content for malicious links and keywords. Also performs periodic, cached checks of user bios to catch dormant threats.

üîé **Proactive & Reactive**:
- **Real-time Actions**: Instantly deletes scam messages and times out offenders.
- **Proactive Bans**: Moderators can issue a global ban by User ID *before* a known scammer joins any server.
- **Retroactive Scanning**: A slash command to find threats already inside your server.

‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Toolkit**:
- **Interactive Alerts**: Alerts with buttons (Ban, Kick, Unban, Ignore) for quick response.
- **Local Control**: Moderators can locally override a federated ban for their specific community.
- **Keyword & Regex Management**: Add and remove keywords and complex regex patterns with slash commands.
- **Federation Stats**: Track bans initiated and received across the network, with federation total.
- **Maintainer Contact**: A slash command for a direct feedback channel to the bot owner.
